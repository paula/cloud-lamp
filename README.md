It started with a dark room. Our co-Founder Kristine was sitting in the dark one day. She needed something, anything really, to illuminate and brighten her day- that's when she came across The Cloud. No, not the same one which Apple uses to store all of your information. It was a simple cloud lamp which served the function of lighting up a room in such a simple way. Unfortunately, the ones she stumbled upon were available for purchase online at a costly price of $3000! A simple ball of fiberfill shouldn't cost this much! Determined to bring the joy of a fluorescent cloud to her dark, sad room, she sought out to create this lamp and to do this, she enlisted her friend Paula. Together, they went on a mission to light up the room, one cloud at a time.

The code is essentially the DemoReel100 Example Code from the FastLED Library but edited to only use the Cloud Color Palette. It is also modified based on the number of LEDs we used and the corresponding data pin.

This project was created in LASA's [Engineering Design](http://www.stempirecentral.com/engineering-design1.html) class. The project page can be found [here](http://cloudlamps.weebly.com) for more information.
